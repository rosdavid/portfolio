# Devlog #1 - v1.0.0-beta.1: The Birth of Mokkio

Welcome to the very first devlog for Mokkio‚Äîa free tool for creating device and browser mockups, watermark-free and with a professional experience. This beta release marks the beginning of a project designed to simplify and elevate mockup creation for designers, developers, and content creators.

## üéØ Vision & Purpose

Mokkio was born out of the need for a fast, customizable, and accessible solution to generate high-quality mockups without hidden costs or limitations. The goal is simple: enable the creation of iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and browser mockups with custom backgrounds, shadows, zoom, and export options in PNG, JPEG, and WebP.

## üöÄ Key Implementations

- **Core Components:** MockupCanvas for advanced rendering, supporting image uploads, gradient backgrounds, and zoom/pan controls. DeviceFrameSelector lets you choose devices by category and size.
- **Smart Sidebars:** LeftSidebar manages images, device selection, and visual styles; RightSidebar controls zoom and layout presets (single, double, triple).
- **Flexible Export:** ExportButton allows exporting in multiple formats and scales (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x), including transparent backgrounds.
- **Modern UI:** Tailwind CSS with a sleek dark theme, shadcn/ui components, and Inter font for a professional, consistent look. Subtle animations and responsive design throughout.
- **Core Features:** State management with React hooks, support for multiple images per device, gradient presets, and a basic undo/redo system.
- **Landing Pages:** Informative sections (Hero, Features, How It Works), welcome popup, legal pages (privacy, terms, cookies), and a cookie banner.
- **Initial Monetization:** Google Ads and Analytics integration, plus support for donations via Ko-fi.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges

- **Scaling & Performance:** Dynamic canvas resizing using ResizeObserver and CSS transforms to maintain quality.
- **Exporting:** HTML-to-image conversion with html-to-image, handling modern color spaces (oklch, lab) via manual sanitization.
- **State Management:** Implemented a history system for undo/redo to handle complex controls and states.
- **Responsiveness:** Optimized for mobile devices, including a MobileBlocker for specific routes.

## üé® UX Improvements

- Tooltips, hover animations, and intuitive design.
- Gradient and solid color presets for easy customization.
- Clear, structured landing page highlighting features and layouts.

## üîÆ Roadmap for Beta.2

Next version plans include advanced effects (noise, blur), customizable canvas sizes, custom background images, keyboard shortcuts, new devices, and performance optimizations.
